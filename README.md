# ANALYTIC-EXPLORATION-OF-LONDON-CRIME-RATES-TIME-SERIES-

In this project, the crime rates in London per thousand population by financial year and borough, that have been recorded by London’s Metropolitan Police Service will be explored and analysed. Are there many criminal offences taking place in London? Is there a vast difference between the maximum amount of offences and the minimum amount if offences that have taken place in the previous years? Is there an offence that takes place a lot in the inner boroughs of London than the outer boroughs of London? Is there an increase or decrease in the number of offences that have taken place? The answers to these questions along with some more will be answered in this iterative process. Since there are many offences that have taken place, our main concern will revolve around the Number of Burglaries, whilst comparing it to the other offences recorded. One of the major findings was that ‘Theft and Handling’ offences occur much more every year in the Inner and outer boroughs compared to the other offences. Many of the crimes have occurred more in the outer boroughs and some more in the inner boroughs of London.
